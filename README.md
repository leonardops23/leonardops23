# Hi, I'm Leonardo Pacheco

I'm a **Full Stack** developer from Guayaquil, Ecuador, passionate about technology and programming. Throughout my career, I have gained experience working with various languages and frameworks, from **JavaScript**, **Python**, and **C**, to **React**, **Django**, **Bootstrap**, and **TailwindCSS**. I'm always looking to learn new technologies and improve my skills.
